# Btech_Project_4th_Year
Glucose-Insulin Homeostasis
This repository includes all my work related to my Btech-Project

You can find about the project in detail in Introduction to the Model.docx

There are 5 models in total that I have made in Matlab -
1).glucose_minimal_model.slx
2).insulin_minimal_model.slx
3).coupled_model.slx
4).modified_model.slx
5).controller.slx

HOW TO RUN ?
For running the model 1,2 and 3 you are required to run the data.m file first.
For running the model 3,5 you are required to run the Modified_Bergman.m file first.
